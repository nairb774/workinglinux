# The host agent implements a DNS server that looks up host names on the host
# using the local system resolver. This means changing VPN and network settings
# are reflected automatically into the guest, including conditional forward,
# and mDNS lookup. By default only IPv4 addresses will be returned. IPv6 addresses
# can only work when using a vmnet network interface and the host has working
# IPv6 configured as well.
